### When to Normalize and Standardize:

Standardization is a scaling technique that assumes your data conforms to a normal distribution.

If a given data attribute is normal or close to normal, this is probably the scaling method to use.

It is good practice to record the summary statistics used in the standardization process, so that you can apply them when standardizing data in the future that you may want to use with your model.

Normalization is a scaling technique that does not assume any specific distribution.

If your data is not normally distributed, consider normalizing it prior to applying your machine learning algorithm.

It is good practice to record the minimum and maximum values for each column used in the normalization process, again, in case you need to normalize new data in the future to be used with your model.
